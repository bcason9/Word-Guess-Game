# Word-Guess-Game

This game uses vanilla javascript to create a "hangman" style game. The user must guess each given word in the alloted number of attempts. This game can be played at https://bcason9.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/

## Future Development
 This game is currently not playable on mobile devices, so in the near future I intend to implement mobile functionality so that it is not limited to computer browser functionality only.
